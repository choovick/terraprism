## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Live streaming: `terraprism plan`/`apply`/`destroy` now open the TUI
  immediately, before `plan` even runs, with a hideable output pane
  (`o`) that streams `terraform`/`tofu`'s real output live — for both
  the `plan` phase and, once confirmed, `apply`.
- Output pane search — `/` highlights every matched occurrence in the
  visible text, not just scrolls to it.
- Output pane word wrap — toggle with `w` (off by default); wrapped
  lines never need horizontal scrolling even when they contain long
  unbreakable tokens (ARNs, hashes, etc.).
- Output pane horizontal scrolling — `h`/`l` or `←`/`→` to inspect long
  lines when word wrap is off.

### Changed

- `internal/tfplan` rewritten to decode `terraform show -json` via
  `hashicorp/terraform-json` into a pre-diffed attribute tree, replacing
  the previous regex/text-based plan parser.
- The interactive tree/search/filter/sort layer moved into
  `internal/foldtree`, a generic, plan-agnostic TUI toolkit (also used by
  the new output pane and by `cmd/foldtree-demo`), with `internal/tui`
  reduced to a thin Terraform-specific adapter on top of it.

### Fixed

- Attributes — and whole nested blocks, e.g. a `helm_release`'s
  `metadata` — that exist before an apply and become wholly unknown on
  update now correctly show "(known after apply)" instead of rendering
  as a plain deletion. A collapsed block whose entire value is unknown
  now shows the same marker on its own collapsed summary line, not just
  once expanded.
- `c` now collapses the nearest collapsible ancestor when pressed on a
  leaf row (previously a no-op there, since only resources and nested
  blocks are themselves collapsible — most attribute rows are leaves).
- History bookkeeping no longer re-reads and re-parses every history
  file's full plan payload on every single plan/apply run just to check
  file ages for cleanup; it now reads only the small metadata block each
  file starts with.
- The cached "update available" result is invalidated when the running
  version changes, instead of replaying a stale answer for up to the
  full 7-day cache interval.
- Restored fold/collapse for multi-line string diffs, fixed viewport
  oscillation/drift at free-scroll boundaries, and fixed mouse-wheel
  scroll snapping at the top/bottom of the list.

### Performance

- Replaced per-call lipgloss styling with precomputed ANSI wrapping on
  the hottest per-row render path, avoiding a user-visible stall on
  large plans.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- Generic collapsible sub-blocks in expanded plan resources for large maps, lists, and heredocs.
- Sub-object navigation in expanded resources: `j`/`k` can move into foldable blocks, and `Enter`/`Space`, `h`, and `l` toggle the selected block.
- Scoped recursive fold controls: `e` and `c` expand or collapse all foldable content under the selected resource or sub-block.
- Global fold controls: `E` and `C` expand or collapse all visible resources and nested foldable blocks.
- Paired remove/add heredocs render as a single foldable diff section instead of separate old/new heredoc blocks.
- Adjustable diff context controls: `+`/`=` show more unchanged context around diff hunks, and `-` shows less.
- One-line viewport scrolling with `Ctrl+E` and `Ctrl+Y` for reviewing large expanded blocks without changing selection.

### Fixed

- Preserve YAML indentation inside heredoc attributes such as `kubectl_manifest.yaml_body_parsed`, including nested Kubernetes lists.
- Avoid hardcoded provider-specific hiding for noisy `helm_release.metadata` output by using generic collapsible blocks instead.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- `terraprism upgrade` — upgrade to the latest release with a single command
- Version check — `terraprism version` shows an update hint when a newer version is available
- TUI footer nudge — when a newer version exists, a timely check (7-day cache) displays an update prompt at the bottom of the screen
- Curl fallback — if self-update fails (e.g. read-only install location), the command prints the manual upgrade instruction
- `TERRAPRISM_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK` — set to 1, true, or yes to skip all update checks
- `TERRAPRISM_UPDATE_CHECK_INTERVAL` — days between TUI update checks (default: 7)

**Upgrade from v0.10.0:** Run `terraprism upgrade` or re-run the install script.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- Terraform/OpenTofu command passthrough — run any terraform/tofu command through terraprism
- `terraprism init`, `terraprism validate`, `terraprism fmt`, `terraprism output`
- `terraprism state list`, `terraprism import`, `terraprism workspace`, `terraprism graph`
- `terraprism console`, `terraprism show`, `terraprism providers`, and more

### Removed

- `--tofu`, `--light`, `--dark` flags — use `TERRAPRISM_TOFU` and `TERRAPRISM_THEME` env vars instead

**Note:** If you relied on these flags, set the corresponding env vars or update your scripts.

### Changed

- Cleaner dispatch: `terraprism init -h` shows terraform help, not terraprism help

## [0.9.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- `TERRAPRISM_TOFU` — set to 1, true, or yes to use OpenTofu instead of Terraform
- `TERRAPRISM_THEME` — set to "light" or "dark" to force color scheme
- CLI flags override env vars when both are specified

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added

- Status filter — filter resources by action (create, destroy, update, etc.)
- Sort — sort resource list by default, action, address, or type
- Sort picker includes hints for each option
- Esc key clears filters from main view or filter picker

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added

- Diff engine with LCS and git-style context diffs
- Word wrap for plan output
- Base64 userdata decoding — decodes `user_data_base64` blocks in diffs for readability
- Granular diff highlighting (additions, deletions, context)
- History picker with scrolling and alt screen
- VHS demo script and README updates with demo GIF

## [0.6.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added

- Full working directory path in history list and picker
- Color-coded output: plan (blue), apply (green), destroy (red)
- Color-coded status: SUCCESS (green), FAILED (red), CANCELLED (yellow)
- Auto-cleanup: removes old files when count exceeds 100
- fzf-style search now includes path in history picker

### Fixed

- Separator width alignment (86 chars)
- Header PATH column padding
- Path column padding for consistent line width
- Unknown option error handling in history list
- Underscore sanitization in project names
- Parser edge case handling for projects named 'plan/apply/destroy'

## [0.5.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added

- `terraprism history list` — list all history with index numbers
- `terraprism history view` — interactive picker with j/k navigation
- `terraprism history view <#>` — view by index (1 = most recent)
- fzf-style multi-term search in picker (`/` to search)
- Project name included in history filenames

### Fixed

- Fix separator width alignment (70 chars)
- Sanitize underscores in project names (filename delimiter)
- Handle edge cases in filename parser (projects named 'plan' etc.)
- Error on unknown options in history list
- Fix header column alignment with printf formatting

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-14

### Changed

- Remove intermediate prompt in apply mode

### Fixed

- Fix duplicate model declaration build error

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-07
