## Features

- **Live output streaming** - The TUI opens immediately for `plan`/`apply`/`destroy`; a hideable pane streams terraform/tofu's real output live, with its own search, word wrap, and horizontal scroll
- **Syntax-highlighted HCL** - Full color-coded display of your plan
- **Collapsible resources and sub-blocks** - Expand/collapse resources, large maps, lists, and heredocs
- **Status filter** - Filter resources by action (create, destroy, update, replace, read, etc.)
- **Sort** - Sort by plan order, action, address, or resource type
- **Search** - Find resources by name, type, or address (works with filters)
- **Vim-style navigation** - j/k/gg/G/d/u plus line scrolling for large blocks
- **Auto light/dark mode** - Detects your terminal background
- **Format support** - Works with Terraform 0.11+ and OpenTofu
- **Full-line selection** - Clear visual indicator of selected resource
- **History tracking** - All plans saved with full path, searchable picker
- **Color-coded CLI** - Commands and status colored in history list
- **Environment variables** - Set `TERRAPRISM_TOFU` and `TERRAPRISM_THEME` to avoid passing flags every time
- **State viewer** - Interactive TUI for `state list`, `state show`, and `state rm` with search, sort, multi-select, taint, and untaint
- **Passthrough commands** - Run init, validate, fmt, and other terraform/tofu commands through terraprism

## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CaptShanks/terraprism/main/install.sh | sh
```

### Using Go

```bash
go install github.com/CaptShanks/terraprism/cmd/terraprism@latest
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CaptShanks/terraprism.git
cd terraprism
make build
```

### Manual Download

Download binaries from the [Releases](https://github.com/CaptShanks/terraprism/releases) page.

## Usage

### Apply Mode (Recommended)

Review and apply in one command:

```bash
# Run plan, review interactively, press 'a' to apply
terraprism apply

# With OpenTofu (set TERRAPRISM_TOFU=1)
TERRAPRISM_TOFU=1 terraprism apply

# Pass arguments to terraform/tofu
terraprism apply -- -target=module.vpc -var="env=prod"
```

### Plan Mode

Run plan and view interactively (no apply):

```bash
terraprism plan
TERRAPRISM_TOFU=1 terraprism plan
```

### State Mode

Interactive TUI for Terraform state with search, sort, show details, remove, taint, and untaint:

```bash
terraprism state list
terraprism state show
terraprism state rm
```

All three subcommands open the same unified TUI. Use **Space** to select items, **Ctrl+Space** to select a range, then **Enter** (show), **t** (taint), **u** (untaint), or **d**/**x** (remove). **Esc** clears selection or dismisses confirmation. Other state subcommands (`state mv`, `state pull`, etc.) pass through to terraform/tofu.

### Pipe Mode

Terraprism reads the structured JSON plan format (`terraform show -json`), not
plan text — it needs a saved plan file to get JSON output from:

```bash
terraform plan -out=plan.bin && terraform show -json plan.bin | terraprism
tofu plan -out=plan.bin && tofu show -json plan.bin | terraprism
```

If you pipe plain `terraform plan` text by mistake, terraprism will tell you
so and print the command above instead of failing silently.

### Read from file

```bash
terraform show -json plan.bin > plan.json
terraprism plan.json
```

### Print mode (non-interactive)

```bash
terraform show -json plan.bin | terraprism -p
```

## Keyboard Controls

### Navigation
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j` / `↓` | Move to next resource or foldable sub-block |
| `k` / `↑` | Move to previous resource or foldable sub-block |
| `gg` | Jump to first resource |
| `G` | Jump to last resource |
| `d` / `Ctrl+D` | Scroll half page down |
| `u` / `Ctrl+U` | Scroll half page up |
| `Ctrl+E` | Scroll one line down |
| `Ctrl+Y` | Scroll one line up |
| `+` / `=` | Show more unchanged context around diff hunks |
| `-` | Show less unchanged context around diff hunks |

### Expand/Collapse
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Enter` / `Space` | Toggle current resource or foldable sub-block |
| `l` / `→` | Expand current resource or foldable sub-block |
| `h` / `←` / `⌫` | Collapse current resource or foldable sub-block |
| `e` | Expand the highlighted item and its foldable sub-blocks (scope) |
| `c` | Collapse the highlighted item and its foldable sub-blocks (scope) |
| `Shift+E` | Expand all visible resources and all nested foldable sub-blocks |
| `Shift+C` | Collapse all visible resources and all nested foldable sub-blocks |

Large maps and lists inside expanded resources become foldable sub-blocks. Large sub-blocks collapse by default; use `l`/`→` or `Enter`/`Space` to expand them, then `Ctrl+E`/`Ctrl+Y` to scroll through the expanded content without moving the selection. When a resource or sub-block is selected, `e` and `c` recursively expand or collapse the foldable content underneath that selection.

Multi-line string values (Helm chart values, cloud-init scripts, JSON policy documents) are shown as a focused line-by-line diff rather than one opaque blob. Use `+`/`=` and `-` to increase or decrease the unchanged context shown around each diff hunk.

### Sensitive Values
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `x` | Reveal/hide the real value of sensitive attributes |

Sensitive attributes are redacted as `(sensitive value)` by default, matching Terraform CLI. Press `x` to reveal the real diff for the rest of the session (off again next time you run `terraprism`); press it again to re-redact.

### Search
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `/` | Start search |
| `n` | Next match |
| `N` | Previous match |
| `Esc` | Clear search (or clear filters when filters active) |

### Filter
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `f` | Open filter picker |
| `Esc` | Clear all filters (from main view or picker) |

In the filter picker: **Space** toggle status, **a** select all, **c** clear all, **Enter** apply, **Esc** clear and close.

### Sort
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `s` | Open sort picker |

Sort options: default (plan order), by action, by address, by type.

### Apply (in apply mode)
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `a` | Apply the plan (only offered once, and only if the plan has changes) |
| `y` | Confirm apply |

Once apply finishes, a banner shows the result and auto-quits after 10 seconds (press `q` to quit immediately, or `Esc` to cancel the countdown and keep reviewing). Applying again requires a fresh `terraprism apply` (a full re-plan), since the plan file just applied is now stale.

### Output Pane (plan/apply mode)
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `o` | Toggle the live terraform/tofu output pane |
| `j`/`k`, `gg`/`G` | Navigate the pane |
| `/`, `n`/`N` | Search within the pane, highlighting matches; cycle matches |
| `w` | Toggle word wrap (off by default) |
| `h`/`l` or `←`/`→` | Scroll sideways (when word wrap is off) |

The pane opens automatically as soon as `plan` starts, before it even
finishes, and again when `apply` starts once confirmed — quitting is
disabled for the duration of either so a running `terraform`/`tofu`
process is never orphaned.

### State Mode (state list/show/rm)
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `j`/`k`, `↑`/`↓` | Navigate (highlight item) |
| `Space` | Toggle selection of highlighted item |
| `Ctrl+Space` | Select range from anchor to current |
| `Enter` | Show details (opens immediately, no confirmation) |
| `t` | Taint selected (confirmation required) |
| `u` | Untaint selected (confirmation required) |
| `d` or `x` | Remove from state (confirmation required) |
| `/` | Search |
| `f` or `s` | Sort (by address, type, module depth) |
| `Esc` | Clear selection or dismiss confirmation |
| `q` | Quit |

In the detail view: `/` search within content, `e`/`c` expand/collapse all blocks, `j`/`k` scroll, `y` copy full content, `Y` copy line at top (OSC 52).

### Other
| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `q` / `Ctrl+C` | Quit (cancel apply) |

## Color Themes

Terra-Prism automatically detects your terminal background and uses appropriate colors:

### Dark Mode (Catppuccin Mocha)
- Green for resources being created
- Red for resources being destroyed
- Yellow for resources being updated
- Purple for resources being replaced
- Blue for data sources being read

### Light Mode (Catppuccin Latte)
Automatically switches to darker, more visible colors on light backgrounds.

### Force a theme
```bash
TERRAPRISM_THEME=dark terraprism plan.json   # Force dark mode
TERRAPRISM_THEME=light terraprism plan.json  # Force light mode
```

## Commands

```
terraprism                     # View piped/file input
terraprism plan                # Run terraform plan and view
terraprism apply               # Run plan, view, and apply
terraprism destroy             # Run destroy plan and apply
terraprism state list|show|rm  # Interactive state TUI (search, sort, taint, untaint)
terraprism history             # Manage history files
terraprism version             # Show terraprism and terraform/tofu version
terraprism upgrade             # Upgrade to the latest release
terraprism init|validate|fmt|output|state|import|...  # Pass through to terraform/tofu
```

## Options

```
-h, --help      Show help message
-v, --version   Show version (includes update check and terraform/tofu version)
-p, --print     Print colored output without interactive TUI
```

## Environment Variables

Set these to avoid passing flags every time:

```
TERRAPRISM_TOFU    Set to 1, true, or yes to use OpenTofu instead of Terraform
TERRAPRISM_THEME   Set to "light" or "dark" to force color scheme
TERRAPRISM_SKIP_UPDATE_CHECK   Set to 1, true, or yes to skip update checks
TERRAPRISM_UPDATE_CHECK_INTERVAL  Days between TUI update checks (default: 7)
```

Example: add `export TERRAPRISM_TOFU=1` to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` to always use OpenTofu.

## Upgrading

Upgrade to the latest release:

```bash
terraprism upgrade
```

If self-update fails (e.g. binary in read-only location), re-run the install script:

```bash
curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CaptShanks/terraprism/main/install.sh | sh
```

When a newer version is available, terraprism shows an update nudge in the TUI footer and when running `terraprism version`.

## Passthrough Commands

Any terraform/tofu command not enhanced by terraprism (init, validate, fmt, output, state mv/pull/push, import, workspace, graph, console, login, logout, providers, force-unlock, show, refresh, taint, untaint) is passed through to the selected engine. Use terraprism as a drop-in replacement:

```bash
terraprism init
terraprism init -upgrade
terraprism validate
terraprism fmt -recursive
terraprism output
terraprism state mv src dst   # state mv, pull, push, etc. pass through
terraprism state list        # state list, show, rm use interactive TUI
```

## History

All plan and apply outputs are automatically saved to `~/.terraprism/` for future reference. History includes the full working directory path and is color-coded for easy reading.

### Listing History

```bash
terraprism history list              # List all history files
terraprism history list --plan       # List only plan files
terraprism history list --apply      # List only apply files
terraprism history list --destroy    # List only destroy files
```

Output shows timestamp, command (colored), status (colored), and full path:
```
  #  TIMESTAMP         COMMAND  STATUS        PATH
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  1  2026-01-14 12:52  plan                   .../infrastructure/aws/prod/eks-cluster
  2  2026-01-14 10:30  apply    [SUCCESS]     .../infrastructure/aws/staging/vpc
```

### Viewing History

```bash
terraprism history view              # Interactive picker with search
terraprism history view 1            # View most recent entry
terraprism history view 3            # View 3rd most recent
terraprism history 1                 # Shorthand for 'view 1'
```

The interactive picker supports:
- **j/k** - Navigate up/down
- **/** - Search (fzf-style, multiple terms)
- **Enter** - Select and view in TUI
- **q/Esc** - Cancel

Search by project, command, status, date, or path:
```
/myproject apply success    # Find successful applies for myproject
/2026-01 destroy            # Find January 2026 destroys
```

### File Naming

Files are named: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_<project>_<command>[_<status>].json`

Each file is a JSON envelope containing terraprism's own metadata
(timestamp, command, working directory, args) alongside the raw
`terraform show -json` plan bytes, so it's directly inspectable with `jq`.
Upgrading from a version prior to the JSON-based rewrite invalidates old
`.txt` history files — they are no longer read by `terraprism history`.

- `plan` - Plan-only commands
- `apply` - Apply commands (status: success, failed, cancelled)
- `destroy` - Destroy commands (status: success, failed, cancelled)

### Cleanup

```bash
terraprism history list --clear      # Delete all history files
```

History is automatically cleaned up when exceeding 100 files (oldest removed first).

`plan`/`apply` also briefly write a binary plan file (`terraprism-*.tfplan`)
into the same `~/.terraprism/` directory — it's not a history entry (only
`.json` files show up in `history list`/`view`) and is removed
automatically once the run finishes. If a run is ever killed before it
can clean up after itself, any leftover `.tfplan` file older than 5 hours
is swept the next time you run `plan` or `apply`.

## Why Terra-Prism?

Large Terraform plans can be difficult to review:

- Hundreds of resources make it hard to find specific changes
- Long attribute values span multiple lines
- No easy way to focus on specific resources
- Color coding from Terraform can be lost when piping

Terra-Prism solves these problems:

- Collapsible sections and sub-blocks for high-level overview
- Filter by status to focus on creates, destroys, updates, etc.
- Sort by action, address, or type for organized review
- Consistent syntax highlighting
- Search to find specific resources (works with filters)
- Vim-style navigation for resources, sub-blocks, and large expanded content
- Auto-scrolling keeps selection visible
